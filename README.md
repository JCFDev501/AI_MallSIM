# AI_MallSIM
This project focuses heavily on AI behavior. It incorporates concepts like utility theory and utilizes Unreal Engineâ€™s behavior tree.

This was a final that i chose to do for my ai class, i was tasked to developed a ai mall simulator. To sum it up we spawn pawns/shoopers into a world, they can shop, rest, work, go home. thease decisions are determined using utility theory and then are executed using unreals behavior trees. on top of all that pawns swapn in with certain attributes and certain interest.
I also added a schedual system that the pawn work off of, each pawn starts with a different schedual that determins what locations they will prioritize.(Home, work, Mall)

Skills I gained from this project:
-- Refined my experience on Ai programming allowing me to programming ai that are more life like

-- Improved my understanding of unreal and gave me access and knowledge on using more of unreals toolkit 

-- Gave me a better perspective of working on and designing bigger projects as a programmer

-- I learned new ai concepts like pathfinding, utility theory, behavior trees ....

-- Improved my c++ and unreal knowledge

-- I am able to understand and develope my own games with better and realistic ai
